Part 2.1
1) There are two types of intents (explicit and implicit). 
           - Explicit intents are used to launch a specific app component by explicitly stating the target component's name or class. Implicit intents do not specify a specific target component, but instead declare an action to be performed, allowing the system to find the appropriate component to handle the request based on the intent's data and category. Implicit intents are useful when multiple apps can handle the same action, such as sharing a file.
2) Explicit intent is generally more secure because it allows you to specify the target component, reducing the chances of an unintended app responding to the intent and potentially compromising security.
3) Implicit intent is shown between lines 69-73 > var intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)
4) Explicit intent is shown between lines 68-70 > var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
5) Between these two intents the proper way to do an intent is done within ThirdFragment.kt as this is the explicit intent. On line 68, ProductScrollingPage is passed to deliver the explicit intent activity (var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)) which is only passed within the application.

Part 2.2) To fix the incorrect intent I added permission restrictions to the AndroidManifest.xml file. Then I removed the implicit intent within the SecondFragment.kt file and added var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java) this line instead.
